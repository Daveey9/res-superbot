# res-superbot

# Project
In this project, we would create a chatbot from scratch for a restaurant without utilising any third-party APIs.
We would also be developing the chatbot's independent components.
Our chatbot will be demonstrated in a GUI. 

# Deployment
The chatbot would be accessible online.
To host and activate our bot online, we would use the AWS cloud platform.
